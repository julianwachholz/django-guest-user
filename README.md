# django-guest-user

Allow anonymous visitors to interact with your site like a temporary user
("guest") without requiring registration.

Inspired by and as an alternative for [django-lazysignup](https://github.com/danfairs/django-lazysignup)
and rewritten for Django 3.1+ and Python 3.7+.

## Documentation

Find the [**complete documentation**](https://django-guest-user.readthedocs.io/)
on Read the Docs.

## Quickstart

1. Install the `django-guest-user` package from PyPI
2. Add `guest_user` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and migrate your database
3. Add `guest_user.backends.GuestBackend` to your `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`
4. Include `guest_user.urls` in your URLs
5. Decorate your views with `@allow_guest_user`:

   ```python
   from guest_user.decorators import allow_guest_user

   @allow_guest_user
   def my_view(request):
       assert request.user.is_authenticated
       return render(request, "my_view.html")
   ```

A more detailed guide is available in the
[installation documentation](https://django-guest-user.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#how-to-install).

## Development Status

This project is under active development. Thanks to
[previous work](https://github.com/danfairs/django-lazysignup) the core
functionality is well-established and this package builds on top of it.

This project was created because the original project has been in an inactive
state without major updates in a long time. The code base was rewritten with
only modern versions of Python and Django in mind.
